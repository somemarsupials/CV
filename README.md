## Skills

#### Project delivery

With two and a half years' consultancy experience, I have experience with the following:

+ managing projects
+ delivering things to (tight) deadlines
+ engaging with clients
+ doing lots of things at the same time

In my previous role involved developing models and tools for varying clients, including UK government departments and national governments. In certain cases, these models were developed as part of large projects featuring technical subject matter and co-operation across multiple teams. Key examples of my previous assignments include the following:

+ co-ordinated development of a GHG emissions projection for the government of a large Middle-Eastern country
+ led the development of a discrete choice model for the UK's Department for Transport
+ managed the delivery of life cycle assessment models for multiple UK businesses

#### Analysis

As a physicist with philosophical training, I am familiar with thinking through tricky issues. I've used my analytical skills in a range of situations, including:

+ Modelling global oil consumption in the road transport (BSc disseration project)
+ Assessing financial feasibility of energy storage in the UK (MSc thesis)
+ 

#### Really curious

I'm interested in programming and computer science. The logic makes me happy - writing code is like playing with digital Lego. My journey began when I started tinkering with Python, which I've taught myself over the course of the past two years. I've since become familiar with Python's SciPy stack and tkinter, Python's native GUI toolkit. I've also learned to write code in C. I even read Kernighan and Ritchie's textbook! 

I enjoy nothing more than using the skills that I've acquired to achieve things. I started with a program designed to solve word problems that arise during a game I that play with friends. Later on, I started using Python at work to pick up things that Excel couldn't handle.

Since starting the course at [Makers Academy](#makers-academy), I've become proficient in Ruby and gained experience with a range of web technologies.
