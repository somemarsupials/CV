## Theo Breuer-Weil

I'm a full stack developer, currently looking for a junior developer role.

I'm interested in programming and computer science. My journey began when I started tinkering with Python, which I've taught myself over the course of the past three years. Given that I enjoyed doing this in my spare time, I decided to leave my role as an environmental consultant and learn to develop software.

Since completing a full stack web development course at [Makers Academy](#makers-academy), I've become proficient in Ruby and JavaScript. I've also gained experience with a range of web technologies, including React, web sockets, Rails and Express. I'm really keen to continue on my journey and find a place where I can learn and improve as a developer.

## Sample projects

Project | Description | Stack
--- | --- | ---
[QuizLife](https://github.com/antoniobelmar/Pub-Quiz-App) | Quiz app using web sockets | Node.js, React, Mocha, Enzyme
[Gilded Rose kata](https://github.com/somemarsupials/gilded-rose-ruby) | Solution to Gilded Rose kata | Ruby, Rspec
[OhNotifier](https://github.com/somemarsupials/oh-notifier) | Jasmine-style test runner | Node.js
[bnfparsing](https://github.com/somemarsupials/bnfparsing) | Experimental parser generator | Python, Unittest

## Skills

#### Project delivery

With two and a half years' consultancy experience, I have experience with the following:

+ managing projects
+ delivering things to (tight) deadlines
+ engaging with clients
+ doing lots of things at the same time

In my previous role involved developing models and tools for varying clients, including UK government departments and national governments. In certain cases, these models were developed as part of large projects featuring technical subject matter and co-operation across multiple teams. Key examples of my previous assignments include the following:

+ co-ordinated development of a GHG emissions projection for the government of a large Middle-Eastern country
+ led the development of a discrete choice model for the UK's Department for Transport
+ managed the delivery of life cycle assessment models for multiple UK businesses

For example, I helped co-ordinate and build the model underpinning [this](http://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Israel%20First/Israel%20INDC.pdf) report.

#### Analysis

As a physicist with philosophical training, I am familiar with thinking through tricky issues. I've used analytical skills in a range of situations, including:

+ Modelling global oil consumption in the road transport (BSc disseration project)
+ Assessing financial feasibility of energy storage in the UK (MSc thesis)

#### Really curious about code

See above! I really enjoy learning to use new technologies and understand new ideas. I've spent time learning to understand things like C and Redux and I think this helps me to write better code.
